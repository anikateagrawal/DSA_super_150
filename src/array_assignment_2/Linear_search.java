/*
Take as input N, the size of an array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Take another number’s input as M. Write a function which returns the index on which M is found in an array, in case M is not found -1 is returned. Print the value returned.

It reads a number N.
2.Take Another N numbers as an input and store them in an Array.
Take another number M as an input.
If M is found in the Array the index of M is returned else -1 is returned and print the value returned.
Input Format
