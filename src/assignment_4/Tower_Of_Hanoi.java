No bigger ring can be placed over a smaller ring.

Input Format
Single line input containing a single integer N denoting the no of rings.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10

Output Format
Print the instructions to move all the rings from peg A to B in a new line each.
Each line should follow format : Moving ring i from A/B/C to A/B/C

Sample Input
4
